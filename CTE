1. SQL Query for CTE: -this is part of the task to find the average amount paid from the top 5 customers in the top 10 country and top 10 cities.

WITH average_cte AS (SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name AS customer_first_name, B. last_name AS customer_last_name, D.city, E. country,
SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B on A. customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B. address_id= C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C. city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E on D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE E.country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
AND D.city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pinxiang','Sivas','Celaya'
'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id,B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_amount_paid),2) AS average_amount_paid FROM average_cte


2. 2nd SQL Query for CTE: - This query was used to find out the number of top 5 customer in each country

WITH top_customers_cte AS
(SELECT A.customer_id AS custID, B.first_name AS customer_first_name, B. last_name AS customer_last_name, D.city, E. country AS country_,
SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer AS B on A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address AS C ON B.address_id= C.address_id
INNER JOIN city AS D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E on D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pinxiang','Sivas','Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
   
GROUP BY A.customer_id,B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT(DISTINCT top_customers_cte) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address AS B ON A.address_id= B.address_id
INNER JOIN city AS C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country AS D on C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_customers_cte ON D.country = top_customers_cte.country_ GROUP BY country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
